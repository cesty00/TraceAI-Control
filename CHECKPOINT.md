CI repair for TraceAI Diagnostics observability is now officially validated on `main`:

- PR: #85 — CI: make TraceAI Diagnostics observable on PR failures.
- The pull-request path now runs `Smoke pytest` on `ubuntu-latest`.
- The `pull_request` smoke path uploads `TraceAI-Diagnostics-Smoke` artifacts.
- The full Windows diagnostics path remains reserved for `workflow_dispatch` or `main`.
- The smoke artifact inspected in this session contains both `pytest-output.txt` and `diagnostic-summary.md`.
- This change improves CI observability without changing product code, DTOs, JSON contracts, calculations, traceability rules, source parsing, or report rendering.

RELEASE-GUARDRAILS-01 is now officially merged on `main`:

- PR: #95 — docs: add release readiness checklist and Robocop stop conditions.
- Adds `docs/release_readiness_checklist.md`.
- Adds `docs/robocop_stop_conditions.md`.
- Scope is docs-only.
- No production code, tests, workflows, DTOs, JSON contracts, calculations, source mappings, verdict rules, extraction logic, or unit handling changed.

ERRORS-01_PR2_4 is now officially merged on `main`:

- PR: #93 — ERRORS-01_PR2_4: map unreadable official sources to typed error.
- Squash merge commit on `main`: `31293753d54ad3c23e33f1f335263af86be4877b`.
- Canonical validated head before merge: `d9fef1be26fb1b3f3ace527d4bc521891f58ccd6`.
- `run_traceability_case()` now maps official sources that are present but unreadable/corrupt to `DataQualityBlockingError` before the generic `NoMatchingRecordsError` fallback.
- Focused regression coverage exists in `tests/test_run_traceability_case.py`.
- Official validation inspected on PR smoke path from workflow run `#220`.
- Artifact inspected: `TraceAI-Diagnostics-Smoke`.
- Artifact contents confirmed: `pytest-output.txt`, `diagnostic-summary.md`.
- Official pytest result from job log: `164 passed in 0.94s`.

ERRORS-01 PR 2.3 remains officially validated on `main`:

- PR: #87 — ERRORS-01_PR2_3: map ambiguous case type to typed error.
- Approved typed-error mapping is present in `src/rules/run_traceability_case.py`.
- Focused regression coverage exists in `tests/test_run_traceability_case.py`.
- Official validation artifact inspected in this session confirms the typed-error path is covered and the relevant diagnostic artifacts were generated.

REPORT-QUALITY-01E-3 remains officially validated on `main`:

- Approved 01E-3 conformity-summary text is present in `Rezumat de conformare checklist` in `src/report/audit_checklist_docx.py`.
- Approved 01E-3 conformity-summary text is also present in `src/ui/audit_checklist_json.py`.
- Focused regression coverage exists in `tests/test_audit_checklist_docx.py` and `tests/test_audit_checklist_ui_json.py`.
- Official validation artifact inspected in this session confirms the generated checklist DOCX contains the approved 01E-3 text.
- UI JSON conformity description matches the approved 01E-3 text.

- PR: #74 — mark incomplete finished-product reports explicitly.
- For `FINISHED_PRODUCT`, the report is marked `INCOMPLETE` when one or more essential evidence groups are missing.
- Minimum strict-audit evidence set:
  - PRD production evidence
  - `WMS production-out`
  - upstream evidence (`raw_materials`, `packaging`, or `auxiliaries_gas`)
- Shared audit/report layer now makes incomplete cases explicit without moving business logic into UI.
- UI JSON and DOCX continue to derive from the same audit source of truth.
