CI repair for TraceAI Diagnostics observability is now officially validated on `main`:

- PR: #85 — CI: make TraceAI Diagnostics observable on PR failures.
- The pull-request path now runs `Smoke pytest` on `ubuntu-latest`.
- The `pull_request` smoke path uploads `TraceAI-Diagnostics-Smoke` artifacts.
- The full Windows diagnostics path remains reserved for `workflow_dispatch` or `main`.
- The smoke artifact inspected in this session contains both `pytest-output.txt` and `diagnostic-summary.md`.
- This change improves CI observability without changing product code, DTOs, JSON contracts, calculations, traceability rules, source parsing, or report rendering.

ERRORS-01 PR 2.3 remains officially validated on `main`:

- PR: #87 — ERRORS-01_PR2_3: map ambiguous case type to typed error.
- Approved typed-error mapping is present in `src/rules/run_traceability_case.py`.
- Focused regression coverage exists in `tests/test_run_traceability_case.py`.
- Official validation artifact inspected in this session confirms the typed-error path is covered and the relevant diagnostic artifacts were generated.

REPORT-QUALITY-01E-3 remains officially validated on `main`:

- Approved 01E-3 conformity-summary text is present in `Rezumat de conformare checklist` in `src/report/audit_checklist_docx.py`.
- Approved 01E-3 conformity-summary text is also present in `src/ui/audit_checklist_json.py`.
- Focused regression coverage exists in `tests/test_audit_checklist_docx.py` and `tests/test_audit_checklist_ui_json.py`.
- Official validation artifact inspected in this session confirms the generated checklist DOCX contains the approved 01E-3 text.
- UI JSON conformity description matches the approved 01E-3 text.

ERRORS-01 PR 2.2 completed:

- PR: #76 — Map blocking core failures to typed errors.
- Squash merge commit: `6f662bff6f1ce7f880117e60060b4fc09e6d3061`.
- `run_traceability_case()` now raises typed errors for the most common blocking user-facing failures.
- Covered blocking cases:
  - no official sources found in the selected folder
  - blocking required-column gaps that prevent usable selection
  - no matching records for the requested code and lot
- Error classification remains in the engine layer, not in UI.
- Focused regression tests added in `tests/test_run_traceability_case.py`.

ERRORS-01 PR 2.3 completed:

- PR: #87 — ERRORS-01_PR2_3: map ambiguous case type to typed error.
- `run_traceability_case()` now raises `AmbiguousCaseTypeError` when selected records exist but case classification remains `UNKNOWN`.
- Error classification remains in the engine layer, not in UI.
- Focused regression coverage exists in `tests/test_run_traceability_case.py`.
- Official TraceAI Diagnostics validation inspected on head commit `e14ec471fe76959143705b819e677b28271dcfc6` from workflow run `#204`.
- Merged on `main` through PR #87.

STRICT-AUDIT-01 completed:

- PR: #74 — mark incomplete finished-product reports explicitly.
- For `FINISHED_PRODUCT`, the report is marked `INCOMPLETE` when one or more essential evidence groups are missing.
- Minimum strict-audit evidence set:
  - PRD production evidence
  - `WMS production-out`
  - upstream evidence (`raw_materials`, `packaging`, or `auxiliaries_gas`)
- Shared audit/report layer now makes incomplete cases explicit without moving business logic into UI.
- UI JSON and DOCX continue to derive from the same audit source of truth.

CI-REPAIR-01 completed:

- PR: #85 — CI: make TraceAI Diagnostics observable on PR failures.
- Adds a `pull_request` smoke path on `ubuntu-latest`.
- Preserves artifact-oriented diagnostics intent on CI paths.
- Smoke validation inspected on head commit `1eaf9ddbe7637efc705169dd76184f34811039f0` from workflow run `#200`.
- Merged on `main` through PR #85.

REPORT-QUALITY-01E specification available as docs-only guidance:

- `docs/report_content_quality_01e.md` defines recommended audit texts and safe future exception-zone rules.
- Safe path: keep the specification docs-only on top of current `main`, then implement one approved text block at a time with focused tests.

## Windows validation result

- Result file: `installer/windows/VALIDATION_RESULT_2026-05-04.md`
- Commit validated by Windows artifact: `08fd6dad191ee508f3cd5ae8ce0a3699a718d68a`
- Environment: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro, Version 10.0.19045 Build 19045, CEZAR-PC
- Verdict: ACCEPTED

## Active documents

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/robocop_operating_manual.md`
- `docs/report_quality_01.md`
- `docs/report_visual_design_01d.md`
- `docs/report_content_quality_01e.md`
- `docs/TraceAI_Control_Roadmap_GitHub.md`

## Next recommended stage

No immediate follow-up is required inside CI-REPAIR-01 after merge and smoke validation.

Recommended next work should be chosen explicitly as a new small stage, for example:

- continue ERRORS-01 with another lower-level failure mapped to a typed error
- expose detailed Data Quality issues in JSON / Audit Pack
- another approved `REPORT-QUALITY` content slice if specified

## Rules

- Update `CHECKPOINT.md` and `README.md` after every merged PR, important green diagnostic, Windows validation, or roadmap/status change.
- Do not move business logic into UI.
- Do not let DOCX or UI drift away from the shared audit source of truth.
- Keep changes small, verifiable and architecture-safe.
